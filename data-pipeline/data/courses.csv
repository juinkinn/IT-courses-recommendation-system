They also know that great product management careers are not built alone. From envisioning a product strategy to correctly portraying the product roadmap, the process must be inclusive, interactive, and motivating with modern leadership techniques. As your products grow, you’ll also need to skills to manage teams of teams. This course will enable you to align product teams, product designs, and product development for speed and innovation at scale. | Product Managers have one of the toughest, most demanding positions in the modern product organization. They must be both visionaries and evangelists, as well as facilitators and coaches. Often they must communicate clearly and effectively across a wide range of audiences. To do this well means being the expert in a number of key competencies of leadership. | Modern leadership principles emphasize empowerment and ownership. Meanwhile products require teams to work together at scale. This course will starts by resetting on what is good leadership based on actual data and studies. Not half-proven theories or intuition. Drawing on actual research and met studies we’ll cover the key elements of what makes a good product leader based on work by Jim Collins John Maxwell, Peter Northouse, Melissa Perri, and more. One of the key findings is that a leader’s success is driven by their team, and how well that team aligns with the mission. Understanding this, we’ll show you how to maximize the team’s effect on the leader and vice versa. | Next we’ll dive into how to build the team. This is essential if you want to move the culture and practices of your organization to truly thrive. We’ll also go over principles of encouraging ownership and continuously replenish your leadership pipeline. | In the third week, we’ll look at the core influential competencies of a product evangelist. This means vision setting, roadmapping problems, setting goals and objectives, demoing effectively and more. We’ll also discuss the art of negotiating across departments and interests, and how to manage conflicts to resolution quickly through good leadership and problem solving. | Finally we’ll turn to frameworks for organizing teams at multiple scales of product development.

You’ll learn the fundamentals of how HCI relates to fields like user experience design, user interface design, human factors engineering, and psychology. You’ll also learn how human-computer interaction has influence across application domains like healthcare and education; technology development like virtual and augmented reality; and broader ideas like context-sensitive computing and information visualization. | You’ll then dive into the fundamentals of human-computer interaction. You’ll learn three views of the user’s role in interface design: the behaviorist ‘processor’ view, the cognitivist ‘predictor’ view, and the situationist ‘participant’ view. You’ll discover how these different views of the user’s role affect the scope we use to evaluate interaction. These perspectives will be crucial as you move forward in designing interfaces to ensure you’re considering what goes on inside the user’s head, as well as in the environment around them. | You’ll then learn the gulfs of execution and evaluation, which determine how easily the user can accomplish their goals in a system and how well they can understand the results of their actions. All of user interface design can be seen as taking steps to bridge these gulfs. You’ll also investigate the notion of direct manipulation, which shortens the distance between the user and the objects they are manipulating in the interface. With these tools, you’ll be well-equipped to start designing effective interfaces. | You’ll then take a deeper dive into what humans are even capable of accomplishing.

A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear and non-linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms. | You will delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. Understanding these representations is key to developing algorithms that traverse the entire graph. Two traversal algorithms are studied: Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. Once a graph is traversed then it follows that you want to find the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices. Dijkstra’s algorithm allows you to have a deeper understanding of the Graph ADT. You will investigate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. Two important, greedy algorithms create an MST: Prim’s and Kruskal’s. | Prim’s focuses on connected graphs and uses the concept of growing a cloud of vertices. Kruskal’s approaches the MST differently and creates clusters of vertices that then form a forest. | The other half of this course examines text processing algorithms. Pattern Matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. You begin with the simplest of the algorithms, Brute Force, which is the easiest to implement and understand. Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. However, KMP does an exceptional job of not repeating comparisons once the pattern is shifted. The last pattern matching algorithm is Rabin-Karp which is an “out of the box” approach to the problem. Rabin-Karp uses hash codes and a “rolling hash” to find the pattern in the text. A different text processing problem is locating DNA subsequences which leads us directly to Dynamic Programming techniques. You will break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. Longest Common Subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.","this data structures & algorithms course completes the 4-course sequence of the program with graph algorithms, dynamic programming and pattern matching solutions. a short java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. the course does require prior knowledge of java, object-oriented programming and linear and non-linear data structures. time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms. | you will delve into the graph adt and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. understanding these representations is key to developing algorithms that traverse the entire graph. two traversal algorithms are studied: depth-first search and breadth-first search. once a graph is traversed then it follows that you want to find the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices. dijkstra’s algorithm allows you to have a deeper understanding of the graph adt. you will investigate the minimum spanning tree (mst) problem. two important, greedy algorithms create an mst: prim’s and kruskal’s. | prim’s focuses on connected graphs and uses the concept of growing a cloud of vertices. kruskal’s approaches the mst differently and creates clusters of vertices that then form a forest. | the other half of this course examines text processing algorithms. pattern matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. you begin with the simplest of the algorithms, brute force, which is the easiest to implement and understand. boyer-moore and knuth-morris-pratt (kmp) improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. however, kmp does an exceptional job of not repeating comparisons once the pattern is shifted. the last pattern matching algorithm is rabin-karp which is an “out of the box” approach to the problem. rabin-karp uses hash codes and a “rolling hash” to find the pattern in the text. a different text processing problem is locating dna subsequences which leads us directly to dynamic programming techniques. you will break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. longest common subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.","algorithm, traversal, algorithms, graphs, traverse, graph, java, vertex, tree, dijkstra"

That lets us define problems to be ""decidable"" if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and ""undecidable"" if not.

(2-4) trees are a subgroup of B-Trees and are non-binary trees with more than 2 children. 2-4 defines the range of children that exists in the trees. However, these trees are extremely flexible and allow the nodes to shrink and grow as needed to store more data. With this flexibility comes more issues to handle, like overflow and underflow which require more intense techniques to resolve the issues. | As you enter the algorithm portion of the course, you begin with a couple of familiar iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble and Selection. There are optimizations that can be included in the standard Bubble sort to make it more adaptive in sorting. There is also a derivation of bubble sort, called Cocktail Shaker sort, that puts new a spin on the basic algorithm. Insertion sort is the last iterative sort that is investigated in this group of sort algorithms. Divide & Conquer sorting algorithms are examined and are broken into two groups: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. The two comparison sorts are Merge and In-place Quick sort. Both are recursive and focus on subdividing the array into smaller portions. LSD Radix sort is the non-comparison sort that deconstructs an integer number and examines the digits. All algorithms are analyzed for stability, memory storage, adaptiveness, and time complexity. | The course design has several components and is built around modules. A module consists of a series of short (3-5 minute) instructional videos. In between the videos, there are textual frames with additional content information for clarification, as well as video errata dropdown boxes. All modules include an Exploratory Lab that incorporates a Visualization Tool specifically designed for this course. The lab includes discovery questions that lead you towards delving deeper into the efficiency of the data structures and examining the edge cases. This is followed by a set of comprehension questions on topics covered in the module that count for 10% of your grade. The modules end with Java coding assignments which are 60% of your grade. Lastly, you'll complete a course exam, which counts for the remaining 30% of your grade.","this data structures & algorithms course completes the data structures portion presented in the sequence of courses with self-balancing avl and (2-4) trees. it also begins the algorithm portion in the sequence of courses. a short java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. the course does require prior knowledge of java, object-oriented programming, and linear and nonlinear data structures. time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms. | you will investigate and explore the two more complex data structures: avl and (2-4) trees. both of these data structures focus on self-balancing techniques that will ensure all operations are o(log n). avl trees are a subgroup of bsts and thus inherit all the properties and constraints from bsts. additionally, avls incorporate rotations that are triggered when the tree is mutated and becomes out of balance.

It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. | Relational Databases and SQLis the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data. | All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course. | Why Learn About Databases | Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour.

This is the critical final step of the design life cycle, where we put our prototypes in front of real users (or strong approximations thereof) to get feedback on their quality. You’ll learn about three methods for evaluation: first, qualitative evaluation lets you get direct feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your interface from real users. Second, quantitative evaluation lets you make strong claims about the effectiveness of your interface or the validity of your theories of interaction. Third, heuristic evaluation lets you inject evaluation much more completely into the design process, persistently putting yourself into the mindset of a user to investigate an interface. | Then, you’ll learn how human-computer interaction relates to a modern trend in software development, Agile design. HCI and Agile development have a deep symbiosis in the way they each value rapid feedback. Moreover, modern technologies have allowed high-fidelity prototypes to be developed with the relative ease of low-fidelity prototypes in the past, allowing even better feedback and evaluation to come in throughout the design process. | After wrapping up your understanding of the design life cycle and its iterative nature, you’ll turn your attention to a deeper dive into the modern state of human-computer interaction.

This is the process by which we investigate user needs, brainstorm potential designs, create prototypes, and evaluate those prototypes. This life cycle provides the structure for the third and fourth courses in this professional certificate. | A key part of the design life cycle, however, is human subjects research. In interface design, this involves asking users for information about what they do and what they need, and then asking them for feedback on the prototypes that you develop. In HCI more broadly, this may involve testing different ideas with users to see what facilitates the best user experience. Whenever we interact with users, though, we need to keep in mind users’ rights to privacy and transparency, and so we begin this course with a discussion of ethics in HCI. This is grounded in the university Institutional Review Board process, but also investigates the role of ethics in HCI in industry as well. | From there, you’ll move on to needfinding and requirements gathering. It is always tempting to jump straight into designing an interface based on our intuitive understanding of a task or need, but successful interface design always starts with an understanding of the users: who are they, what they do, and what they need. This involves both interacting directly with them via surveys and interviews, as well as observing them at a distance or even attempting the tasks ourselves. This concludes with an understanding of the requirements of any interface we create. | From there, you’ll move on to brainstorming design alternatives. Again, it is often tempting to jump straight to the design we have in mind, but successful interface design starts with the results of needfinding and attempts a more grounded investigation of possible solutions. Through this lesson, you’ll learn techniques for managing effective brainstorming sessions and approaches to exploring the ideas that are created including artifacts like user personas, interaction timelines, and storyboards. | Finally, you’ll conclude by learning about prototyping. Implementing an interface is a complicated process, and there is a risk that we may invest lots of time into an interface that is doomed to fail because we do not get user feedback on the idea. The goal of prototyping is to get an idea in front of users as quickly as possible to validate and improve it before we move on to the high pressures of implementation. | By the end of this course, you’ll have an understanding of the design life cycle and its first three major stages: needfinding, brainstorming, and prototyping.

Building Modern Java Applications on AWS,https://www.edx.org/learn/java/amazon-web-services-building-modern-java-applications-on-aws?index=product&queryId=7fabad228f552d142c32df8189c08855&position=921,"In modern cloud native application development, it’s often times the goal to build out serverlessarchitectures that are scalable, are highly available, and are fully managed. This mean, less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS. | Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application. | In this class, we will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless compute, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API. | Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks.
